Description: Simple testing API built on Rack
 Rack::Test is a small, simple testing API for Rack apps. It can be used on its
 own or as a reusable starting point for Web frameworks and testing libraries
 to build on. Most of its initial functionality is an extraction of Merb 1.0's
 request helpers feature.
